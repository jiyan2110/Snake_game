# Snake_game
This is a simple console-based Snake game written in C++. The game is played on a 20x20 grid, where the player controls a snake that moves around and eats food to grow longer. The objective of the game is to get the highest score possible by eating as much food as you can without crashing into any walls or the snake's body.
